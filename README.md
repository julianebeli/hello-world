# hello-world
learn you git
I'm a guy who grew up during the invention of personal computers.
My first language was Apple Basic
My second language was 8086 Assembly Code, machine language.
I learnt about registers and accumulators and program counters and jumps
I watched my school fiends do amazing things!
At uni, in Computer Science I used Pascal on unix terminals. The teachers could run your code and test it.
In Architecture I learnt APL.
Then I had a break to be a gardener.
10 years later I was a uni again. The internet was becoming a thing.
I would watch people in computer labs with screens full of IP addresses.
We used software to do stats. I wrote a program to do text analysis using Hypercard.
I looked at Starlogo, Forth and Smalltalk and LISP. Couldn't really understand any of them.
After uni I went to Tech. I learned bash scripting and Pascal and HTML.
Eventually I started working with Python.
As an amateur programmer I just used a procedural style.
Over the many years I came to understand what it object were, but I really came to understand Object Oriented programming by learning Functional Programming.
I'm always keeping my eye on other programming languages because programming is complex art and you are never satified with the tools of a single language.
I think its obvious when you look at the Javascript ecosystem. There are hundreds of 'languages' which compile to Javascript. Why? Because Javascript programming creates dissatisfation.
After years of coding LISP made sense via Clojure and Clojurescript.
Table programming like Excel, made sense, a data transformation pipeline.
